1. conditional syntax: 
if 5 < 3:
    print("Things might be a little off...")
else:
    print("Yep, math works today.")

2. loops: for iterating over sequence of things
	1. for loop: 

		1. To iterate over list: 

			animals = ("whale", "monkey", "rabbit")

			for animal in animals: 
				print(animal)

			output --> whale
					   monkey
					   rabbit

		singers = {"Mariah Carey": "Heartbreaker", "Whitney Houston": "I Will Always Love You", "Nelly": "Country Grammar"}

		1. To iterate over keys: 

			for singer in singers: 
				print(singer)

			output --> Mariah Carey 
					   Whitney Houston
					   Nelly
		
		2. To iterate over values: 

			for song in singers.itervalues(): 
				print(song)

			output --> Heartbreaker
					   I Will Always Love You
					   Country Grammar
		
		2. To iterate over keys and values: 

			for singer, song in singers.iteritems(): 
				print(singer, song)

			output --> Mariah Carey Heartbreaker
					   Whitney Houston I Will Always Love You
					   Nelly Country Grammar

	2. while loop: iterating over series of things given certain conditions 
		miles_run = 0
		running   = True

		while running:
		    if miles_run <= 10:
		        print("Still running! On mile {}".format(miles_run))
		        miles_run += 1
		    else:
		        running = False
		else:
		    print("Whew! I'm tired")


	3. try: use when you want to define what to do when there is an error
		a = 1
		b = 0 

		try: 
			a/b
		except: 
			print("Uh oh. There was an error.")
