1. Anaconda: 
Anaconda is a distribution of Python which includes a lot of packages related to math, science, data analysis, etc.
Installation here: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html
Conda documentation here: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html

2. Package managers: 
Package managers make it easy for you install and maintain packages; they keep track of dependencies b/w packages and make sure everything is up to date and in sync with each other. 

	Pip vs. conda: 
	- Pip is a general purpose Python package manager
	- Conda is a package manager for packages included in Anaconda
	- Pip and conda can be used side by side but not interchangeably 

3. Virtual environments: 
Virtual environments allow you to install and keep packages for your projects in separate places. So if you install a package, this package does not have to be used across all your projects. Project A may require NumPy. Project B may require Scrapy. But Project A doesn't need Scrapy; and Project B doesn't need NumPy. You can also have different versions of packages for different projects.

	Pip: 
	- For pip, use virtualenv

	Conda: 
	- For conda, use conda create
