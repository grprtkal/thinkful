Questions:

Language Processing?

2. What is the typical development environment/work flow for data scientists? Use iPython notebook? Or a text editor
and iPython? In the examples we running functions in iPython.. is it possible to execute a python file in iPython?

3. Go over recursion examples; when would I use this? Is this commonly used in data science?

4. When do you use rU vs just r when reading files? In examples, sometimes show rU, other times just r.

5. What does defaultdict function do -- turns an element in your csv file (i.e integer, string) into a key? This is

Questions:

1. What is stdout (in lesson on Getting Familiar with SQL Lite)
2. How to open a sqlite .db file?
3. How to turn data into string?

import sqlite3 as lite

#connect to database
con = lite.connect("sample_db.db")

with con:
    #create cursor object which goes over records that result from query
    cur = con.cursor()

    #call cursor object's execute method
    cur.execute("SELECT warm_month FROM weather")

    #fetch data from cursor object
    data = cur.fetchone()

    #print result
    print ("Warm month: {}".format(data))

    #output: Warm month: (u'July',)

4. What does con.cursor do?

5. For database.py exercise, I get output as dtype:object -- how to turn this into string?
