Time Series: Y = m + s + e 
Y = series; m = trend; s = seasonal component; e = random noise 

Trend is longer term change (moving average over a certain time span); seasonal component is short term fluctuations 

Exponential smoothing: forecast predictions based on weighted average of most recent observations 
(most recent observations are given most weight)

Horizontal pattern - when data fluctuates randomly around a mean
Trend pattern - when you have small fluctuations but general trend (i.e. increasing or decline)
Seasonal pattern - repeating pattern over successive period (i.e. tides, football sales tickets)
Cyclical pattern - high runs and low runs (i.e. employment, gas) 

Time trend - a steady relationship between response (y) and time (t)
Seasonality - short term perioud relationship between response (y) and time (t)
Cycles - long-term periodic relationship between response (y) and time (t)
Irregular - unobservable time-dependent influences 

Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) - series is function of most recent observations
