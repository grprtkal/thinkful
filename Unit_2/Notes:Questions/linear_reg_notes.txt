Data exploration:
1. Check histogram, scatterplot and/or scatter box plot --> check type of distribution (normal?)

Linear Regression -- check extent to which variables are associated
1. Check p value
2. Check r-squared value

In order to be linear regression, does it have to be normally distributed?
