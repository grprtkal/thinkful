1. Naming conventions for files
2. What is difference between standard deviation and variance (other than how they are calculated)?
3. What is a random variable?
4. Explain this code:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.mlab as mlab

mean = 0
variance = 1
sigma = np.sqrt(variance) # this is the standard deviation
x = np.linspace(-3,3,100)
plt.plot(x, mlab.normpdf(x,mean,sigma))

plt.show()

5. What is the difference between collections library, pandas, and numpy? What to use and when?

6. Explain boxplot
