Use box plot and histogram for plotting distributions

For discrete data:
    1. Box plot
    2. Histograms

For continuous data:
    1. QQ-Plots


For continuous data, we look at marginal distribution or probability density

Normal distribution

Uniform distribution

QQ Plot: plots your data against normally distribution with same mean and SD of your data
